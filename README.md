# I2CS-Loss-Function in Python(Keras)

* Implemented the I2CS loss function for the educatinal perpose.
* All the implementations are based on keras. To install Keras, please see <a  target="blank" href="https://keras.io/"> here</a>

# **Implementation**

* First install tensorflow and keras library.
```
pip install tensorflow
```
```
pip install keras
```

* Second import the I2CS-loss-Layer.
```
import I2CS_layer.py
```
* Third load MNIST dataset from the keras.
* Also use I2CS-loss and I2CS-accuracy as you are fitting the model.
